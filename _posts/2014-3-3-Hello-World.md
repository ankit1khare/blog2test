I used to spend all my active hours (when I was not sleeping) in front of my computer trying to mess up with everything, be it motherboard, RAM chip, Microsoft office, Windows XP <!--more-->(I actually started with Windows 98 and then switched to XP in few months) etc. I had already taught myself basics of OS, computing, HTML and programming in C when I was 14. I even won inter-school HTML competition and made an address book using graphics in C. I thought these were pretty big achievements considering my surroundings and age but later I realized they were not. The sense of accomplishment actually slowed my learning and then halted it completely. PC became a device of playing games for me and then later I started preparing for engineering exams due to which my parents had to lock the PC in the cupboard thinking I would not stray from my target. My journey with computers then resumed when I was got into college, almost 4 years hence.
